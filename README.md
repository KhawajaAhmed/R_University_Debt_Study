# R_University_Debt_Study

# Description 
This project involved an in-depth statistical analysis comparing the average debt of graduates from small private universities with that of graduates from large, private universities in R/RStudio. The goal was to determine whether a statistically significant difference existed between these two groups. To achieve this, I employed two independent sample hypothesis testing procedures, focusing on conducting a two-sample t-test. 

**Achievements**

* **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulated null and alternative hypotheses, essential in hypothesis testing. These hypotheses, H_0: μ_small-μ_large=0 and H_a: μ_small-μ_large>0, provided the basis for the statistical test.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Utilized the R/RStudio and RMarkdown to perform statistical analysis, including data preprocessing, normality assumption validation, and variance equality checks.
* **Data Visualization:** Effectively visualized data using box plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots to assess the normality assumption, supporting the analysis.
* **Hypothesis Test Results:** Conducted a two-sample t-test to evaluate the null hypothesis, with a calculated t-value of -2.2974 and a p-value of 0.9879. Interpretation of the results played a pivotal role in decision-making.
* **Data Summary:** Presented the average debt values for small and large private universities for a comprehensive overview.

**Conclusion:** Summarized the results, highlighting that the t-test did not find a statistically significant difference between the average debt of graduates from small and large private universities.

# Important Note on Data and Findings
This repository contains the code and report format for a study of university debt disparity. While the original analysis was conducted using a dataset that cannot be publicly shared due to privacy reasons, this repository includes a sample dataset sourced from Kaggle to demonstrate the analysis process.

**Key Points to Note**:

* **Sample Data**: The sample dataset is designed to follow the conventions of the original dataset but does not represent the same data used for the original findings.
* **Findings May Differ**: The findings in the report generated from this sample data may differ from the original findings due to differences in the datasets.
* **Purpose**: This repository serves as a demonstration of the methodology and report format rather than a replication of the original study's conclusions.
