# R_University_Debt_Study

# Description 
This project involved an in-depth statistical analysis comparing the average debt of graduates from small private universities with that of graduates from large, private universities in R/RStudio. The goal was to determine whether a statistically significant difference existed between these two groups. To achieve this, I employed two independent sample hypothesis testing procedures, focusing on conducting a two-sample t-test. This is a **sample report** with university data from kaggle. The original report had similar code and format, but was presented to university officials with private data from large and small private univerisities from Indiana. The original data has not been shared due to provacy concerns. 

**Achievements**

* **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulated null and alternative hypotheses, essential in hypothesis testing. These hypotheses, H_0: μ_small-μ_large=0 and H_a: μ_small-μ_large>0, provided the basis for the statistical test.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Utilized the R/RStudio and RMarkdown to perform statistical analysis, including data preprocessing, normality assumption validation, and variance equality checks.
* **Data Visualization:** Effectively visualized data using box plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots to assess the normality assumption, supporting the analysis.
* **Hypothesis Test Results:** Conducted a two-sample t-test to evaluate the null hypothesis, with a calculated t-value of -2.2974 and a p-value of 0.9879. Interpretation of the results played a pivotal role in decision-making.
* **Data Summary:** Presented the average debt values for small and large private universities for a comprehensive overview.

**Conclusion:** Summarized the results, highlighting that the t-test did not find a statistically significant difference between the average debt of graduates from small and large private universities.
